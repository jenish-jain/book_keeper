## Book Keeper
 ### My Problem Statement
* Need a bookkeeping app for managing / keeping a trail of personal statements for things like insurance payments,
mobile and internet bills, MF & investments statements, other things required during taxation and FBP submission
in company / filing taxes.
* Apart from upload and download of these statements, it should also have the capability to remind timely payments 
of some of these things
* have other views to inform who are nominees, what are events for some of these.
  * e.g.: for a LIC when is the maturity and what is the amount
  * for a NPS record. when is the last date, where to access these records?
* How can I & my nominee be informed about any activity / collection of the maturity amount for some of these bits at maturity.
* Everything should have a pleasing UI to make me use the app.
* Integrate with gmail calendar reminders, see if we can have text / whatsapp sms sent for these.
